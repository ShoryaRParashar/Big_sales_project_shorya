Big Sales Prediction
This project focuses on forecasting significant sales figures using a Random Forest Regressor. The objective is to build a reliable and accurate machine learning model that predicts sales based on historical data and key features such as store size, location, and promotional activities.

ðŸ“Œ Key Components

Data Preparation: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

Model Development: Training a Random Forest Regressor on the processed dataset.

Performance Assessment: Evaluating the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Data Visualization: Plotting feature importances and sales predictions to better understand model behavior.

âœ… Outcome
The trained model provides accurate sales forecasts, helping businesses make data-driven decisions for inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation.
