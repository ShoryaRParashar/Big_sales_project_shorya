This project aims to forecast significant sales figures using a Random Forest Regressor. The goal is to develop a precise and reliable machine learning model that leverages historical data and key attributes like store dimensions, geographical location, and promotional efforts to predict future sales.

Key Components

Data Preparation: Addressing missing data, transforming categorical features, and normalizing inputs.

Model Development: Training a Random Forest Regressor on the cleaned dataset.

Performance Assessment: Measuring model effectiveness using evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Data Visualization: Creating plots for feature importance and sales forecasts to interpret model insights.

Outcome
The model delivers accurate sales predictions, supporting businesses in optimizing inventory planning, marketing decisions, and resource distribution.
